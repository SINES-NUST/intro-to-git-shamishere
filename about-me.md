# Introduction
Hi, my name is Shameen and I am currently enrolled in MS program at SINES.

My bachelors was in biosciences from ASAB, NUST.

So far I have been enjoying my time at SINES, I learned plenty of new things and am looking forward to learning more.

# What I have learned so far
## Computing for BI

From this course, I have learned the basics of Python. I previously did have some idea about but I didn't understand it that much. Plus to better understand the language I started learning C as well, which also helped me alot. 

But there is still a lot to learn. As for the rest, I think I learn more from projects so projects related to real-life problems would be appreciated.
